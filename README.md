# Welcome to Choppuh!

## What is Choppuh?
Quoting Apo[KA]lypse:
Player that is Predator 
- has grapple, rocket launcher and railgun, plus invisibility.
All other players
- use blaster, grenades, and machinegun -or- shotgun only (no chaingun, no supershotgun).

Soldier that kills the Predator becomes **it** the next round. 
If Predator kills all soldiers it remains Predator for next round. 
3 subsequent wins as predator wins the game and onto next map. [Up for debate]

**Some more ideas on the table:**
- To stay true to the story, when players get out of the muddy water, they should have temporary invisibility as well.
- Add the chainfist for the Predator. - Colendro - I can remodel it to be true to the design.
- We can see if we can use the Ripper gun's bounce projectile for a Predator Disc
- Original Music Theme :D
